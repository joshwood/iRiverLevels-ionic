## Using this project

First of all you need to install NodeJS.

Once you have installed NodeJS you can use `npm` to install `cordova` and `ionic` by running:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g cordova
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

These commands can be issued from any directory, they are global installs.

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page.

Now change directories to the iRiverLevels-ionic folder and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install the project specific dependencies.
